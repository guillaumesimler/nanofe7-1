Project description
----
This project is a variation of the neighborhood map. It doesn't represent my immediate neighborhood, but the Scottisch Highlands. It's been a while since I want to build an app managing my tours in the Highlands, climbing [Munros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro)

This variation should fit Udacity's project requirements.

This is the 7th project of the Udacity Front End Dev Nanodegree
