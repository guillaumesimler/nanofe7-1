Project description
----
This project is a variation of the neighborhood map. It doesn't represent my immediate neighborhood, but the Scottisch Highlands. It's been a while since I want to build an app managing my tours in the Highlands, climbing [Munros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro)

This variation should fit Udacity's project requirements.

Aim of the project
----

The aim of this project is to train how to use (i) AJAX requests and (ii) Frameworks, such as Knockout.js.

This is the 7th project of the Udacity Front End Dev Nanodegree
